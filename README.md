## Key Functionalities

### 1. Data Cleaning 🧹
- **Upload a Dataset**: Users can upload a CSV file for analysis. 📂
  
- **Cleaning Steps**: Users can select specific cleaning steps:
  - **Handle Missing Values**: Options to fill missing values either by the average or forward fill method. ❓
  - **Remove Duplicates**: Identifies and removes duplicate rows. 🚫
  
- **Propose Cleaning Steps**: The dashboard automatically checks for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formatting, suggesting necessary cleaning steps. 🔍

### 2. Data Visualization 📊
- **Visualization Types**: Users can choose from various types of visualizations, including:
  - Histogram
  - Correlation Heatmap
  - Scatter Plot
  - Box Plot
  - Pair Plot
  - Line Plot
  - Violin Plot
  - Bar Plot
  - Area Plot
  - Pie Chart
  - 3D Scatter Plot

- **Dynamic Variable Selection**: Users can select independent (X) and dependent (Y) variables, with hues option for additional data representation. 🎨

- **3D and Time Series Support**: Users can visualize data in 3D and time series formats. ⏳

---

### 3. Data Analysis 📈
- **Predictive Analysis**: Users can apply different models (Linear Regression, SVM, Clustering) to the cleaned dataset. 🤖

- **Model Visualizations**: Users can visualize results from the applied models, including displaying regression lines and SVM hyperplanes. 📉
